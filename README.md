# BVM
## Hackaday Supercon 2022 Badge Virtual Machine

This project aims to provide a vm for the [2022 Hackaday Supercon Badge](https://hackaday.io/project/182568-badge-for-2020-supercon-years-of-lockdown) to aid in programming and debugging. It is not fully tested and is a work-in-progress.

Python 3.6 (or greater) is required.

Run the program with `python bvm.py [input.bin]`.

Example: `python bvm.py heart.bin` will launch the BVM, reading a text file called `heart.bin` which is a binary file containing machine code ready to be flashed onto a hardware badge.
